think about how often you encounter the,0.04,3.28
following scenario there's a task you're,1.68,3.76
trying to complete but in order to do,3.32,4.36
that simple task you have all this,5.44,4.76
background you have to have all these,7.68,4.36
documents you have to read slide,10.2,3.72
presentations to go over people you have,12.04,4.84
to talk to Concepts you have to,13.92,6.519
understand the problem is who in a crazy,16.88,5.8
busy workday has time to sit down and,20.439,4.961
spend hours reading,22.68,5.48
things hey everyone about a year ago I,25.4,5.08
released a YouTube video on a new,28.16,4.96
experimental AI platform from Google,30.48,5.239
called notebook LM but you know I,33.12,3.8
thought this is probably not going to go,35.719,2.801
anywhere it's just a beta just an,36.92,3.6
experiment but let me tell you I was,38.52,4.16
completely wrong let me show you the,40.52,4.32
five biggest new features that notebook,42.68,4.32
LM has come up with and no this video is,44.84,4.32
not sponsored now before I show my,47.0,3.92
screen I want to answer what I think is,49.16,4.28
a really fundamental question which is,50.92,4.439
what is notebook,53.44,4.88
lm4 especially how is it unique and,55.359,4.601
different from some of the other AI,58.32,3.84
tools out there like chat GPT well I was,59.96,4.08
reading one of the blog posts that the,62.16,4.319
notebook LM team had written and in that,64.04,4.719
post they called it a tool for,66.479,3.68
understanding and I think that's the,68.759,3.321
best simple description I've seen it's,70.159,4.121
the ultimate tool for understanding,72.08,4.52
things there's a lot to cover so buckle,74.28,5.0
up grab a cup of coffee and let's Dive,76.6,5.28
Right In first let's talk about audio,79.28,4.44
overviews imagine if you were setting,81.88,3.279
something or learning something or,83.72,3.399
reading something and you just happen to,85.159,4.201
come across a podcast in your podcast,87.119,4.521
app between two super engaging,89.36,4.52
knowledgeable hosts explaining that,91.64,4.519
thing to you well now you don't have to,93.88,5.4
be lucky you can generate exactly that,96.159,6.081
conversation on demand anytime you want,99.28,4.6
what you see here on my screen is the,102.24,3.64
main interface when you log in at,103.88,5.48
notebook lm. goole.com it's very simple,105.88,5.599
each one of these squares contains all,109.36,4.6
the material for a specific project so,111.479,3.6
the first thing you're usually going to,113.96,3.92
do is Click create new and add some,115.079,4.841
sources these are the sources that you,117.88,3.599
want it to know about that you want it,119.92,4.08
to site and draw from so the project I,121.479,4.761
have in mind is an upcoming trip to,124.0,4.239
Guatemala that my family and I are,126.24,3.879
planning to take this summer this is,128.239,4.041
exactly the kind of project that I would,130.119,3.801
love to spend lots of time on,132.28,3.72
researching the country their culture,133.92,4.319
their history all the itineraries the,136.0,3.68
destinations we could visit the,138.239,3.401
activities the cultural experiences but,139.68,3.52
if I'm really honest with myself it's,141.64,4.36
also the type of project that is likely,143.2,4.84
not to be prioritized I have a lot going,146.0,3.519
on over the next few months I'm writing,148.04,4.12
a book I have two young kids so it's the,149.519,4.961
kind of thing that I know I really could,152.16,4.719
use ai's help with so the first thing,154.48,4.64
I'm going to do is look for some sources,156.879,3.801
that I want to draw on and this can be,159.12,3.6
as simple as opening up Google and,160.68,7.0
typing best places to visit in Guatemala,162.72,6.72
and I'm going to scroll through here,167.68,3.199
these look like great sources these,169.44,2.64
three right here so I'm just going to,170.879,3.761
hold down command and click each one of,172.08,6.0
them which opens them up in tabs along,174.64,4.84
the top up here now I'm not going to,178.08,3.079
read them not going to dive into them,179.48,3.56
all I want them is to stay open right,181.159,4.44
there then let's try YouTube and here,183.04,3.919
I'm going to be a little more specific,185.599,5.041
I'm going to say underrated places to,186.959,7.0
visit in Guatemala so let's open this,190.64,5.4
one again I'm going to hold down command,193.959,4.401
and click I'll do that one and then I,196.04,4.0
even like that this one is specifically,198.36,3.64
about an underrated location so let's,200.04,3.839
add that one all right so this is a good,202.0,4.28
start I have three websites and three,203.879,4.401
YouTube videos which might not seem like,206.28,4.319
a lot but it kind of is it would take me,208.28,4.599
probably an hour or two hours to really,210.599,3.961
dive deep into those so what I'm going,212.879,3.64
to do instead of reading them myself is,214.56,5.12
just add them as sources in Notebook LM,216.519,5.0
let's open up the first website here I'm,219.68,3.839
going to do command L to highlight the,221.519,4.761
URL here and then command C to copy it,223.519,5.041
and then back in Notebook LM you can see,226.28,4.92
right down here I can add Google Drive,228.56,5.2
documents I can add links and I can add,231.2,4.16
pasted text so I'm going to go ahead and,233.76,4.039
click website and then command V to,235.36,5.56
paste and then insert no that I can,237.799,4.921
click on the source right here and this,240.92,3.879
little purple panel will open up called,242.72,3.92
The Source guide The Source guide is,244.799,3.841
just a one paragraph summary of The,246.64,4.48
Source let's go to our second website,248.64,5.36
command L to highlight the URL command C,251.12,4.759
back to notebook LM I'm going to click,254.0,4.04
this add source button right here at the,255.879,5.801
top left website paste it add that as,258.04,6.04
well all right so now I have two sources,261.68,3.76
I'm just going to take a minute here and,264.08,3.88
do the same with this,265.44,6.28
last website,267.96,3.76
and then it looks much the same with,272.479,3.44
YouTube videos you just click the video,273.72,5.039
command L copy the URL of the YouTube,275.919,5.881
video add Source this time click YouTube,278.759,5.72
paste it right,281.8,2.679
there I just remembered a friend who was,284.919,5.12
Guatemalan also sent me a country guide,287.44,6.08
a quite long extensive PDF kind of,290.039,5.321
highlighting and showcasing some of the,293.52,3.959
best places to visit so I'm going to go,295.36,3.88
ahead and add that as well to do that,297.479,4.28
I'll hit add source and this time click,299.24,4.44
choose file to add a file for my,301.759,3.481
computer and I can see it's in my,303.68,3.72
downloads folder right there there we go,305.24,3.6
you can see it right there and there's,307.4,3.239
one more thing I want to add which is in,308.84,4.56
my notes which is this suggested,310.639,5.521
itinerary that the friend who is the one,313.4,4.4
getting married who we're going to visit,316.16,3.52
actually suggested for us so they,317.8,5.959
suggested a 6 day 7 night itinerary,319.68,5.239
definitely want to take that into,323.759,3.041
account so I'm going to go ahead and do,324.919,4.28
command a to select all that text,326.8,5.16
command C to copy head back over to,329.199,4.801
notebook LM and this time I'm going to,331.96,4.32
hit add source and right over here where,334.0,4.479
it says copied text what that allows me,336.28,5.12
to do is to Simply paste whatever text I,338.479,5.681
want right into the little window here,341.4,4.919
hit insert and that is now a source as,344.16,3.84
well this is a good start you can see,346.319,3.521
here I have eight different sources I'm,348.0,4.199
working with and before I click this big,349.84,4.199
generate button here I'm going to,352.199,3.84
customize the conversation a little bit,354.039,4.361
so I'm going to say just give it some,356.039,5.6
context and details,358.4,3.239
and then I'll click generate this is,362.84,2.6
what you're going to see it says,364.44,2.72
generating conversation there's a little,365.44,3.68
circle here and this will take somewhere,367.16,4.479
between around 3 to 6 minutes so I,369.12,4.88
usually go get a cup of coffee or go to,371.639,4.12
the bathroom or just take a little,374.0,4.4
stretch break while this is generating,375.759,4.121
all right so we're fast forwarding here,378.4,3.32
a few minutes 3 or 4 minutes but you can,379.88,4.48
see here it has now generated a 21,381.72,5.68
minute 12 second podcast conversation,384.36,4.76
that I would love to share with you now,387.4,4.519
here it is okay so get this our listener,389.12,6.0
is heading to Guatemala summer of 2025,391.919,5.441
nice a week they say and they want the,395.12,3.88
authentic experience yeah did you know,397.36,3.239
that some of the world's most sought,399.0,3.36
after coffee beans come from the,400.599,4.281
volcanic slopes surrounding Antiga I did,402.36,4.239
I actually saw something about that,404.88,4.159
apparently Antiga has this like booming,406.599,4.921
coffee scene not just plantations but,409.039,5.081
like Artisan Roasters and cafes yeah I,411.52,5.2
think one of the Articles recommended,414.12,5.16
this place called artista de Cafe oh,416.72,5.159
nice saying it was like this hub for,419.28,5.16
local artists and coffee connoisseurs,421.879,4.04
I'll go ahead and pause that now but you,424.44,3.319
can see that this conversation is not,425.919,3.72
just perfectly realistic and,427.759,3.321
indistinguishable from a human,429.639,2.801
conversation but it's completely,431.08,3.0
customized based on the instructions,432.44,3.12
that I gave them but you know what you,434.08,3.559
can even customize this further and that,435.56,4.0
is through a beta feature called,437.639,4.081
interactive mode where believe it or not,439.56,4.24
you can actually click a button and join,441.72,5.0
the conversation in real time yourself,443.8,4.959
so I've just remembered a key detail,446.72,3.68
that I forgot to mention so let's go,448.759,3.72
ahead and enter interactive mode and,450.4,4.199
chime in on this conversation so I'll go,452.479,3.921
ahead and start playing the podcast,454.599,4.44
again okay so get this our listener is,456.4,6.12
heading to Guatemala summer of 2025 nice,459.039,5.321
a week they say so watch what happens,462.52,3.519
when I click this join button and,464.36,3.959
interrupt the conversation oh hey there,466.039,4.28
how can we help hey guys I appreciate,468.319,4.44
this but I forgot one key detail which,470.319,4.241
is that we're going to have two small,472.759,4.56
kids with us ages 2 and four could you,474.56,4.96
please give us a recommended itinerary,477.319,4.28
taking that into account oh wow okay,479.52,3.959
that's definitely a key detail yeah,481.599,3.401
traveling with a two and four-year-old,483.479,3.72
changes things okay so let's unpack this,485.0,4.199
and tailor our itinerary a bit yeah,487.199,3.72
we'll need to balance adventure with,489.199,3.761
kid-friendly options right we were about,490.919,3.96
to get into how to experience Guatemala,492.96,4.04
like a local and honestly that's totally,494.879,3.72
doable with kids it's going to mean,497.0,3.72
adjusting the pace a little exactly like,498.599,4.121
maybe fewer super long travel days and,500.72,3.919
more focus on activities that engage,502.72,4.68
young ones all right so I don't know if,504.639,4.84
you caught that but this is the most,507.4,4.56
remarkable demonstration of AI that I,509.479,4.36
think I've ever seen I think this is so,511.96,4.48
powerful for a few reasons one is,513.839,4.521
there's a lot of people out there who,516.44,4.32
don't learn best by reading reading is,518.36,4.88
actually really taxing and boring they,520.76,4.199
need to listen to it but there's another,523.24,4.159
reason which is think about the typical,524.959,4.401
chat interactions that people have with,527.399,5.401
AI in a chat format the onus the burden,529.36,5.28
is always on you to keep the,532.8,3.76
conversation moving forward you have to,534.64,3.439
think of a question you have to think of,536.56,3.08
a prompt you have to keep putting an,538.079,3.241
effort to make progress this is,539.64,4.08
completely different this is Two Hosts,541.32,3.959
who are very knowledgeable about the,543.72,3.84
topic and the sources having their own,545.279,4.481
conversation completely independently of,547.56,4.719
you it's more passive in many ways but,549.76,4.88
that's good very often especially in,552.279,4.081
your first encounter with something you,554.64,4.4
want this kind of superficial surface,556.36,5.479
level survey of the landscape that way,559.04,5.2
you even know what topics are relevant,561.839,4.401
what questions to ask I've been using,564.24,4.8
audio overviews exactly that way anytime,566.24,5.719
I want just a kind of General summary or,569.04,5.799
survey of a topic I go straight here and,571.959,5.681
generate a personalized podcast,574.839,5.081
conversation on that topic I'm going to,577.64,4.52
go ahead and close this window here on,579.92,4.12
the side and one last thing I want to,582.16,4.119
show you is that you're not limited to,584.04,4.56
the audio overview if the hosts talk,586.279,4.0
about something you find interesting and,588.6,3.84
want to know more about well you have,590.279,4.401
all the sources already loaded up here,592.44,4.04
you can go right here at the bottom to,594.68,3.8
the little chat window and ask anything,596.48,4.16
you want for example I'm going to say,598.48,4.96
why is antia so underrated I'm kind of,600.64,4.879
afraid maybe it's dangerous maybe it's,603.44,4.32
not super safe so I I want to know why,605.519,4.481
do tourists not tend to go there and,607.76,4.0
there you go you can see a much more,610.0,3.72
in-depth bullet point by bullet point,611.76,4.319
summary of what makes it so underrated,613.72,5.48
and each one of those statements is,616.079,5.361
cited and if you click on one of those,619.2,5.6
little citations it takes you exactly to,621.44,4.88
that part of the source that it's,624.8,4.24
referring to and then last thing you can,626.32,5.16
also create structured documents so,629.04,4.799
let's say that you are studying,631.48,4.4
Guatemala and you actually really decide,633.839,4.0
you want to go deeper if you click this,635.88,3.8
button right here the study guide it,637.839,4.521
will generate an entire document with a,639.68,5.76
quiz answer key essay questions glossery,642.36,5.4
of key terms looks like a lot of the,645.44,4.839
specific destinations it's mentioning so,647.76,5.04
you're not limited to a surface level,650.279,4.56
conversation you can go as deep and as,652.8,4.279
detailed as you want now there's one,654.839,4.521
more example of what you can do with,657.079,3.921
with audio overviews that I want to show,659.36,3.84
you so let's head back out to the main,661.0,4.839
interface I'm going to create a new,663.2,4.96
notebook and the example I showed you,665.839,4.56
with my Guatemala trip was an example,668.16,4.6
that uses external sources sources that,670.399,4.041
you can find on the internet but you can,672.76,4.16
also use your own internal thoughts,674.44,5.16
feelings ideas journal entries and,676.92,4.12
that's what I want to show you next so,679.6,2.84
I'm going to go ahead and click on,681.04,3.84
Google Docs and then right down here I,682.44,5.16
have my endof year journaling at the end,684.88,4.6
of every year I do something called an,687.6,4.52
annual review or a year-end review where,689.48,5.24
I think back to the past year and just,692.12,4.64
reflect and journal on different,694.72,3.919
Milestones that happened Precious,696.76,4.24
Memories goals that I achieved lessons I,698.639,4.401
learned and all that journaling is,701.0,3.8
contained in this document right here,703.04,4.08
which I'm going to insert as a source,704.8,5.44
called thiago's 2024 year-end journaling,707.12,4.8
you can see that there's a summary here,710.24,3.44
of what this document is about and I'm,711.92,3.719
just going to add that single source and,713.68,5.56
go ahead and generate an audio overview,715.639,5.481
I'll fast forward a few minutes here and,719.24,3.52
now we can listen hey everyone and,721.12,4.24
welcome to uh another Deep dive with us,722.76,4.519
yes welcome today we're going to be uh,725.36,5.159
looking at Thiago Forte's 2024 year in,727.279,6.24
review which is something that uh he,730.519,6.041
recommends people do and uh he practices,733.519,5.0
what he preaches so yes does and it's,736.56,3.0
also kind of interesting that he,738.519,2.601
actually expresses some anxiety about,739.56,3.959
doing the review oh really even though,741.12,4.079
this is kind of his area of expertise I,743.519,2.68
know I was going to say this is kind of,745.199,3.281
his thing yeah is to like reflect and,746.199,4.521
review and he even has anxiety about it,748.48,4.2
he does he's worried about coming across,750.72,4.64
as performative or you know not digging,752.68,4.8
deep enough all right I'll spare you the,755.36,4.24
rest of that what I found so fascinating,757.48,4.4
about this is several things first of,759.6,5.08
all it gives me such an interesting kind,761.88,5.84
of Outsider perspective on my life you,764.68,4.64
know I can go back and read my own,767.72,4.359
journal entries but hearing what feels,769.32,5.0
like two other humans talking about it,772.079,4.641
in depth they're fascinated by the,774.32,3.84
insights I've come up with they're,776.72,3.64
impressed at some of the the goals that,778.16,4.84
I've accomplished they're empathetic and,780.36,5.12
they sympathize with some of the hard,783.0,5.0
painful lessons that I had it really,785.48,5.919
helps me just get out of my own,788.0,5.72
perspective uh see my life from this,791.399,3.921
more objective point of view which,793.72,2.919
honestly gives me so much more,795.32,3.72
appreciation so much more gratitude,796.639,4.721
helps me kind of be more objective about,799.04,5.08
even the life and the year that I had uh,801.36,5.0
which is just kind of a really powerful,804.12,3.92
tool for personal growth it's something,806.36,3.08
that I'm definitely going to make part,808.04,3.72
of my my journaling practices going,809.44,4.8
forward next up we have feature number,811.76,6.199
two which is an expanded context window,814.24,6.36
I know this might seem like a boring,817.959,4.921
backend technical feature you're like,820.6,3.72
why do I care about this I don't even,822.88,3.44
know what a context window is but this,824.32,3.6
is in some ways actually the most,826.32,4.48
important this single seemingly backend,827.92,5.919
technical feature completely radically,830.8,5.279
changes what is possible with AI imagine,833.839,3.601
if you had a guidance counselor who,836.079,3.281
could recommend the perfect Next Step in,837.44,4.079
your learning based not just on guessing,839.36,4.56
or a few small details about you but on,841.519,4.201
the entire history of everything you've,843.92,4.4
ever read and consumed notbook LM uses,845.72,5.799
Google's Gemini 2.0 flash aai model,848.32,6.6
which can now take in get this up to 50,851.519,8.0
sources each one of which can have up to,854.92,7.279
"500,000 words just to do the math for",859.519,6.56
you that's up to 25 million words of,862.199,6.64
context that is so much higher than any,866.079,5.12
other AI tool out there and basically,868.839,4.041
means you're never going to hit the,871.199,4.241
limit almost any conceivable use case,872.88,4.959
can fit within 25 million words but let,875.44,4.68
me take a step back and explain what is,877.839,4.36
a context window and why does it matter,880.12,4.6
think of AI as having two kinds of,882.199,4.32
memory just like humans there's,884.72,3.76
long-term memory and there's short-term,886.519,4.281
memory an ai's long-term memory is,888.48,4.359
basically what's called its training,890.8,4.12
data all the data that went into its,892.839,4.201
creation and basically these days all,894.92,4.359
the major AI models have the same same,897.04,4.64
training data more or less which is the,899.279,4.721
entire internet they're all trained on,901.68,4.719
the internet which means paradoxically,904.0,5.279
that there's no real advantage in its,906.399,4.921
long-term memory in its training data,909.279,4.12
because it's the same across all the AI,911.32,5.16
models a short-term memory is the data,913.399,4.88
that it's working with right now like,916.48,3.44
what is the conversation it's having,918.279,3.441
right now the problem it's trying to,919.92,4.279
solve right now the person you it's,921.72,4.32
talking with right now most of the,924.199,4.361
advantage of working with AI now comes,926.04,4.4
from that short-term memory the,928.56,3.32
specifics of the problem you're trying,930.44,4.079
to solve the history of the product or,931.88,4.84
your company your specific skills and,934.519,4.481
resources you have access to things,936.72,3.96
you've tried and whether they worked or,939.0,4.519
not that kind of data which we call your,940.68,6.44
context is what you supply to the AI for,943.519,5.56
it to know something about you the,947.12,4.8
context window this term I keep using is,949.079,5.921
simply the limits of how much context,951.92,5.359
you can give the AI until recently it,955.0,4.48
"was maybe a few thousand words or 10,000",957.279,4.841
"words or maybe 30,000 words now with",959.48,5.32
Gemini 2.0 flash that has radically,962.12,5.48
expanded to 25 million words let me give,964.8,4.68
you some examples imagine you work in,967.6,3.52
product development and you could load,969.48,4.32
up an entire folder full of hundreds or,971.12,5.159
even thousands of in-depth customer,973.8,5.12
interviews and then ask notebook LM to,976.279,5.161
evaluate and analyze an idea you have,978.92,5.2
for a new product based on all those,981.44,4.639
past interactions imagine if you work in,984.12,3.639
a nonprofit and you can upload an,986.079,4.041
archive of every every single Grant,987.759,5.32
you've ever won plus a directory of,990.12,5.199
hundreds of currently open grants and,993.079,4.2
then ask it to tell you which Grant,995.319,4.361
proposals you're most likely to win and,997.279,4.92
then to actually write the proposal,999.68,4.599
drawing on the mission statement of your,1002.199,3.76
organization imagine if you're having a,1004.279,3.48
mysterious medical problem and you can,1005.959,4.68
load up your entire medical history and,1007.759,5.121
ask it to identify any recurring,1010.639,3.88
patterns even across different,1012.88,4.199
Specialties imagine if you could upload,1014.519,5.0
the entirety of your personal notes from,1017.079,4.12
years of reading and highlighting and,1019.519,3.601
note taking and every time you encounter,1021.199,3.961
a new idea such as in a book you could,1023.12,4.559
ask the AI if there are any existing,1025.16,4.799
connections to that idea in your notes,1027.679,3.961
you know what let's make this concrete,1029.959,3.561
let's actually take that last example of,1031.64,3.84
loading up all your notes and do it in,1033.52,4.88
real time so I'm going to go ahead and,1035.48,7.079
create a new notebook and I actually use,1038.4,6.279
a service called readwise which,1042.559,3.841
automatically syncs all of the,1044.679,3.801
highlights that I make from any ebook,1046.4,4.519
that I read read or uh any online,1048.48,4.52
article or other online content that I,1050.919,4.561
save in a centralized Place rewise,1053.0,4.24
actually has a partnership with notebook,1055.48,4.079
LM that allows you to export the,1057.24,3.84
entirety of all those notes and,1059.559,4.24
highlights to Google Docs in a format,1061.08,4.4
that's perfectly designed to be loaded,1063.799,3.681
up into notebook LM you can check out my,1065.48,4.0
first video for more details on how that,1067.48,4.48
works what this allows me to do is to,1069.48,4.52
open up my Google Drive here and I'll,1071.96,5.36
find five Google Docs worth of all those,1074.0,6.64
highlights so what I'm going to to do is,1077.32,5.04
Select each of these by holding down,1080.64,3.56
command as I click them I'll click,1082.36,4.199
insert and there we go took about 2,1084.2,4.28
minutes but you can see in this one,1086.559,4.161
little paragraph right here that it's,1088.48,5.12
essentially summarized a broad swath of,1090.72,5.319
my learning my research my interests,1093.6,4.64
across over a decade of my life and this,1096.039,4.12
is where it really gets fun at this,1098.24,4.559
stage because I can ask at some really,1100.159,5.0
deep penetrating questions about the,1102.799,5.12
history of my my personal growth my,1105.159,4.801
learning my educ a in my career for,1107.919,5.521
example I can say please summarize a,1109.96,7.4
list of my most common recurring,1113.44,7.28
interests based on these,1117.36,6.199
notes there we go we can see not taking,1120.72,4.72
in Knowledge Management types of notes,1123.559,3.48
the value of externalizing thoughts,1125.44,3.2
habits and routines the importance of,1127.039,3.921
making connections all huge areas of,1128.64,4.36
interest but then let me go beyond what,1130.96,5.0
is found in this message here and say,1133.0,7.08
what are some other ideas topics and,1135.96,8.04
areas of interest that are likely to,1140.08,7.52
resonate With Me based on this,1144.0,6.159
list so it's essentially like a teacher,1147.6,4.24
suggesting other things that I might,1150.159,3.361
want to learn about now let's go beyond,1151.84,5.319
that and say please create a study guide,1153.52,8.12
and reading list to help me dive deeper,1157.159,7.601
into these topics it's broken up into,1161.64,5.44
chapters and then each chapter has key,1164.76,4.84
questions activities and readings,1167.08,5.24
including including my own book I love,1169.6,5.48
this using AI as a tool here's a bigger,1172.32,4.479
reading list and additional,1175.08,3.24
recommendations each one of these,1176.799,3.681
recommendations is drawing on so much,1178.32,4.16
existing knowledge about me they're not,1180.48,5.48
random or one siiz fits-all this is a,1182.48,5.84
perfectly personalized learning,1185.96,4.52
curriculum that has been generated based,1188.32,4.56
on years of my notetaking do you get why,1190.48,5.0
an expanded context window is so,1192.88,4.56
critical the possibility that this is,1195.48,4.04
opening up is a completely different way,1197.44,4.04
of interacting with AI it's not about,1199.52,4.84
designing these crazy extensive prompts,1201.48,4.88
it's not about meticulously organizing,1204.36,3.799
your sources it's really just about,1206.36,4.559
pointing the AI at a massive repository,1208.159,5.841
of information and letting it do the,1210.919,6.161
work let's talk about new feature number,1214.0,5.919
three which is multimodal sources,1217.08,4.839
multimodal is just a fancy word that,1219.919,4.601
means many different kinds of formats,1221.919,4.921
notebook LM can now take basically any,1224.52,3.92
kind of format that you want to throw at,1226.84,4.079
it there's URLs from web pages and,1228.44,4.56
YouTube videos like we saw you can put,1230.919,5.161
in PDFs you can put in text Google Docs,1233.0,4.76
audio files you could take a little,1236.08,4.04
voice memo note while walking around,1237.76,4.24
your neighborhood and then upload that,1240.12,4.439
but the most exciting and newest one is,1242.0,6.32
images specifically images within Google,1244.559,5.881
Slides think about how often you,1248.32,4.599
encounter information in modern work,1250.44,4.92
especially in the form of slides,1252.919,4.161
presentations that someone is giving to,1255.36,3.6
you or you're giving to someone else,1257.08,4.4
sales calls technical specifications,1258.96,4.719
slides are a very common format these,1261.48,3.76
days and you can now work with those,1263.679,3.88
directly in Notebook LM let me show you,1265.24,4.24
what that looks like as always I'll,1267.559,4.72
start by creating a new notebook and,1269.48,4.199
then I'm going to click right here where,1272.279,4.121
it says Google Slides go over to recent,1273.679,5.36
and let's use as an example a recent,1276.4,5.08
presentation that was sent to us by our,1279.039,5.081
insurance agent proposing a couple new,1281.48,4.319
health benefits packages for our,1284.12,3.679
employees so this is the kind of,1285.799,4.24
information that is important has high,1287.799,4.36
stakes it matters that I pay attention,1290.039,4.921
to it but it's also just so incredibly,1292.159,5.52
mindly boring that I want to spend as,1294.96,5.079
little time loading up this information,1297.679,4.48
into my brain as possible so I've loaded,1300.039,4.24
it up as a source as you can see here,1302.159,3.961
you can see there's a little summary,1304.279,3.841
which is that uh they're proposing two,1306.12,4.799
new health benefits packages okay so my,1308.12,6.679
first question is please compare and,1310.919,7.841
contrast the two proposed packages so,1314.799,6.201
you can see here there's a summary uh,1318.76,4.6
comparing their deductibles their office,1321.0,5.84
visit costs monthly and annual cost but,1323.36,5.12
you know what this is a little bit too,1326.84,4.64
extensive so I'm going to say please,1328.48,6.6
summarize more succinctly what is the,1331.48,7.6
core difference between these plans and,1335.08,6.28
there we go the core difference is in,1339.08,4.44
the cost of office visits and the,1341.36,5.16
overall monthly cost with A1 the first,1343.52,5.36
option being more expensive so as the,1346.52,4.519
founder and CEO of this business that is,1348.88,3.76
really the bottom line for me I don't,1351.039,3.441
really need to know all the fine grain,1352.64,4.48
details that is for our insurance agent,1354.48,4.6
that's for the operations person on my,1357.12,4.2
team the decision of which plan to go,1359.08,4.68
with Falls with me and what matters at,1361.32,4.16
the end of the day is the cost so I'm,1363.76,4.64
actually going to ask it to perform an,1365.48,6.92
analysis of what the cost difference,1368.4,8.44
would be between these two plans for six,1372.4,8.159
employees over the the course of a year,1376.84,6.48
and there we go its analysis is that the,1380.559,5.961
"first A1 plan would cost 15,000 almost",1383.32,6.04
"$166,000 more per year so this is the",1386.52,4.6
part that is actually most important to,1389.36,3.52
me I'm actually going to highlight this,1391.12,4.159
part and say save to note which is what,1392.88,5.56
I do anytime the AI gives me something,1395.279,5.561
that is actually valuable longterm that,1398.44,3.92
I want to keep track of I just click,1400.84,3.719
that button and it saves it over here in,1402.36,5.12
this little uh right hand bottom corner,1404.559,4.48
but the purpose of this demonstration,1407.48,3.559
was to show you how it works with images,1409.039,4.0
and slides so what I'm going to do is,1411.039,3.441
let's say I would like to know the,1413.039,3.441
source of this I want to check that it's,1414.48,4.36
accurate myself I can go ahead and click,1416.48,4.92
this little one here which is the,1418.84,5.56
citation and it takes me directly to the,1421.4,4.6
table where it shows that price,1424.4,3.759
difference so notice when we look at the,1426.0,4.679
slides here how complex this information,1428.159,4.961
is it's multicolored it's in columns,1430.679,5.401
rows it is not an easy thing to absorb,1433.12,5.88
but diagrams charts IM images,1436.08,5.04
photographs all these kinds of things if,1439.0,4.4
they're embedded in slides can now be,1441.12,4.559
understood by notebook LM and that's the,1443.4,5.44
multimodal capability now let's talk,1445.679,5.841
about feature number four which is a,1448.84,5.6
redesigned interface if we head back to,1451.52,5.639
our Guatemala notebook as an example the,1454.44,5.119
whole interface for a given notebook is,1457.159,5.361
divided into these three columns which,1459.559,5.12
they call panels on the left is the,1462.52,4.279
sources panel this is simply what,1464.679,4.161
sources the AI is working with and,1466.799,4.36
drawing from and you can expand that or,1468.84,3.839
once you've sort of settled on the,1471.159,3.081
sources and you're not going to do a lot,1472.679,3.801
of changes here you can just collapse,1474.24,3.6
that so you have more space for the,1476.48,3.12
other ones the second panel which is,1477.84,4.28
this middle part is the chat panel which,1479.6,4.24
is where you actually speak with and,1482.12,3.679
interact with the AI it's nice to make,1483.84,3.6
this large because sometimes it gives,1485.799,3.401
quite extensive answers that you want to,1487.44,3.88
be able to see in this wider format for,1489.2,4.44
example if I click this question what,1491.32,4.239
cultural and historical significance,1493.64,4.2
shapes Guatemala's top destinations you,1495.559,4.6
can see it's probably around 500 Words,1497.84,4.0
so if I like this answer and I decide I,1500.159,3.481
want to keep it for later I can just,1501.84,3.8
scroll down click the save to note,1503.64,4.639
button and it saves just this one answer,1505.64,4.72
which I've decided is valuable over here,1508.279,4.12
on the bottom right this is called the,1510.36,3.96
studio panel this one on the right and,1512.399,4.201
it does a number of things this is where,1514.32,4.479
you create and interact with audio,1516.6,4.76
overviews it's where you have these,1518.799,5.441
pre-made options such as creating a,1521.36,5.36
study guide or a briefing document or a,1524.24,4.679
frequently asked questions or timeline,1526.72,5.439
for example if I click the FAQ button,1528.919,5.201
it's now generated in a question and,1532.159,4.441
answer format a summary of the different,1534.12,4.08
sources that we're working with so I can,1536.6,3.12
go ahead and close that but I'd say the,1538.2,3.56
most important part is these notes when,1539.72,3.6
you have a conversation with an AI,1541.76,3.32
unless you take an action it kind of all,1543.32,3.599
just disappears over time so you want to,1545.08,3.839
be sure if you get a good answer to just,1546.919,3.721
click that little save to note button,1548.919,3.401
and over time you'll have here at the,1550.64,3.36
bottom right almost you can think of it,1552.32,4.52
like the final output the gems the,1554.0,4.72
Evergreen insights that you want to take,1556.84,3.839
away from this conversation are all,1558.72,3.88
going to be saved here in the notes,1560.679,4.401
section so that's the overall interface,1562.6,4.84
but for me by far the most important new,1565.08,4.28
addition over the last year has been,1567.44,5.04
these little numbers see those there's,1569.36,5.319
kind of a big problem with most modern,1572.48,4.72
AI tools which is they hallucinate they,1574.679,4.24
make things up which is kind of a,1577.2,4.12
paradox because the more you depend on,1578.919,5.441
AI to execute important tasks and even,1581.32,5.68
make decisions the less you can trust it,1584.36,4.52
because you never know if it's,1587.0,3.32
hallucinating one thing I really,1588.88,4.039
appreciate about the notebook LM team's,1590.32,4.8
philosophy is they had from the very,1592.919,5.041
earliest prototypes this idea of source,1595.12,5.279
grounding what source grounding means is,1597.96,4.76
that especially for information that is,1600.399,4.52
in the context window that short-term,1602.72,3.839
memory that we talked about it's,1604.919,3.441
basically not going to hallucinate or,1606.559,3.921
very very rarely you can check that it's,1608.36,3.919
not hallucinating you can essentially,1610.48,4.36
double check the ai's answers by simply,1612.279,4.441
clicking one of these little numbers,1614.84,3.76
which are the source citations I'm going,1616.72,4.16
to go ahead and click on the 16 and it,1618.6,4.199
not only opens up the original source,1620.88,3.76
which is this YouTube video it takes me,1622.799,4.321
to and highlights exactly the point that,1624.64,4.279
that came from this is a huge deal you,1627.12,4.0
guys you have to be able to trust what,1628.919,4.041
the AI is telling you and this new,1631.12,4.32
interface with inline citations is a,1632.96,5.04
huge step forward for that and finally,1635.44,5.239
feature number five let's talk about it,1638.0,5.44
for the very first time there is now a,1640.679,5.88
paid upgraded version of notebook LM the,1643.44,5.0
basic version which is most of what,1646.559,4.12
you've seen here is free and I would,1648.44,4.08
expect it to remain free most of,1650.679,5.24
Google's core tools are free but if you,1652.52,5.639
work on a team or a company or,1655.919,4.321
organization that wants to use notebook,1658.159,4.481
LM it may be worth checking out there's,1660.24,4.6
actually three separate ways to get,1662.64,4.48
notebook LM Plus either through Google,1664.84,4.28
workspace which you may have as part of,1667.12,4.919
your company through Google cloud or,1669.12,4.52
through Google one which can be,1672.039,3.24
purchased individually the pricing,1673.64,3.48
depends on exactly how you purchase it,1675.279,4.441
but it seems to be something around $20,1677.12,4.679
per month and there's four main things,1679.72,4.92
that you get as part of notebook LM plus,1681.799,5.48
the first one is an even bigger context,1684.64,5.32
window so instead of 25 million words,1687.279,4.64
you can have and this is just kind of,1689.96,3.88
mindboggling up,1691.919,5.561
to 15 million words the only use case I,1693.84,5.439
can think of for that is if you're at a,1697.48,3.52
company and you want to put in like all,1699.279,3.88
of the company's data into a prompt the,1701.0,4.279
second thing you get is five times,1703.159,4.12
higher usage limits so that means you,1705.279,4.12
can create five times more audio,1707.279,3.921
overviews and have five times more,1709.399,4.081
notebooks again mostly useful if you're,1711.2,3.959
working with a lot of other people on a,1713.48,3.439
team or in a company the third plus,1715.159,4.201
feature is what are called chat modes if,1716.919,4.12
you click on this button right here you,1719.36,4.919
can give notebook LM certain almost like,1721.039,5.201
personalities that it takes on in your,1724.279,3.481
interactions so let's say in this,1726.24,3.279
conversation you want it to take on the,1727.76,4.24
role of an analyst it will become more,1729.519,4.16
critical and more analytical or it could,1732.0,3.84
be more of a guide almost like a teacher,1733.679,4.521
or you can Define your own personality,1735.84,3.679
so let's say you wanted to act as a,1738.2,3.88
marketing expert or a life coach or a,1739.519,4.4
research assistant you can actually,1742.08,3.64
Define that and describe it right here,1743.919,3.48
in this box and then you can also,1745.72,3.679
customize it to make its responses,1747.399,4.721
longer or shorter but the fourth and I,1749.399,5.201
think by far the most important plus,1752.12,5.32
feature is the ability to collaborate,1754.6,5.16
within notebook LM think about it have,1757.44,4.2
you ever had a particularly interesting,1759.76,3.68
interaction with an AI you're getting,1761.64,3.68
some real insights and some real New,1763.44,3.359
Perspectives and then you think I want,1765.32,3.68
to share this there's often not an easy,1766.799,3.961
way to do that except copying and,1769.0,3.36
pasting things and sending them to,1770.76,3.799
people via email or slack or whatever,1772.36,3.84
but then you lose all the interaction,1774.559,3.921
it's just a static piece of text with,1776.2,4.4
plus you could actually get this entire,1778.48,4.24
notebook click this share button right,1780.6,4.12
here customize the permissions at a,1782.72,3.559
welcome note if you'd like and then,1784.72,3.24
choose whether you want to share the,1786.279,3.801
full notebook with all the sources that,1787.96,4.319
you've added with all the customizations,1790.08,4.52
with all the notes you saved or you can,1792.279,4.4
make it chat only you could give the,1794.6,3.64
people on your team or the people who,1796.679,3.24
work for you your employees or or even,1798.24,3.64
external collaborators the ability to,1799.919,4.521
talk with and go back and forth with the,1801.88,5.679
essentially custom AI model that you've,1804.44,5.44
created without you having to copy and,1807.559,3.881
paste stuff once you've decided on the,1809.88,3.36
settings all you have to do is click,1811.44,3.64
this link right here to copy the link,1813.24,3.36
and send it to them and they'll have,1815.08,3.88
access via their own free Google,1816.6,4.64
notebook LM account overall I would say,1818.96,4.04
plus really makes the most sense for,1821.24,4.319
people who have adopted notebook LM,1823.0,4.48
pretty seriously and are using it with,1825.559,4.641
others as part of companies like I,1827.48,5.6
said okay I've shared a lot with you so,1830.2,4.4
let's take a step back and kind of,1833.08,3.4
summarize the big picture here I think,1834.6,3.84
the big shift that's happening right now,1836.48,3.919
with notebook LM with this much bigger,1838.44,4.359
context window is just like a great,1840.399,5.64
teacher it's gaining a really fantastic,1842.799,5.401
shortterm memory think about how,1846.039,4.601
important it is that a great teacher can,1848.2,5.0
follow the thread of the topic that it's,1850.64,4.159
teaching you a great teacher can,1853.2,3.479
reference previous conversations what,1854.799,3.521
you just said a few minutes ago they can,1856.679,3.561
think into the future and plan out,1858.32,3.56
different stages of a curriculum that,1860.24,2.72
they're going to be teaching and,1861.88,2.639
coaching you through we're living in a,1862.96,4.439
time of just incredibly Fast Change in,1864.519,5.12
no small part because of AI but if,1867.399,4.081
there's one thing that I can say for,1869.639,3.801
certain it's that we're all going to,1871.48,4.679
have to learn much faster and much more,1873.44,5.839
often having an AI powerered worldclass,1876.159,5.64
teacher with a fantastic memory sitting,1879.279,4.801
next to you and guiding you through this,1881.799,4.801
unpredictable landscape is just a world,1884.08,4.479
changing and even life changing,1886.6,3.919
phenomenon that we all now have access,1888.559,4.08
to if anything that I covered resonated,1890.519,4.081
I encourage you to create a free account,1892.639,4.961
at notebook lm. goole.com and let me,1894.6,6.52
know what you think,1897.6,3.52
